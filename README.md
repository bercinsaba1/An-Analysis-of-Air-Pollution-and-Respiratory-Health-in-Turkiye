# Air Pollution and Upper Respiratory Tract Diseases Relationship

In this project, we aim to analyze the connection between air pollution levels in Turkey and deaths related to upper respiratory tract diseases. This README.md file provides an overview of the project's objectives, data sources, analysis methods, and findings.

## Project Objectives

Analyze air pollution levels in cities of Turkey.
Examine mortality data related to upper respiratory tract diseases.
Investigate the relationship between air pollution and upper respiratory tract diseases.

## Data Sources

The following data sources were used for this project:

- PM10 Air Pollution Data
- Mortality Data for Upper Respiratory Tract Diseases
- Population Data for Cities of Turkey

## Analysis Methods

- Data Collection: Obtain PM10 air pollution data for various cities in Turkey. Gather mortality data related to upper respiratory tract diseases.

- Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the relationship between PM10 levels and upper respiratory tract disease mortality rates through visualizations and statistical summaries.

- Statistical Analysis: Conduct chi-square hypothesis test to determine the significance of the observed associations.

- Interpretation of Results: Analyze the findings and draw conclusions regarding the relationship between PM10 air pollution and upper respiratory tract disease mortality.

## Conclusion

By conducting this data analysis project, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the potential link between air pollution and upper respiratory tract diseases in Turkey. The results obtained will provide valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers working in the field of environmental health.
